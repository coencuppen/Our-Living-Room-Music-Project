# Our-Living-Room-Music-Project

This program is part of an art project started by Jor Broeder.
An old retro tv is showing random noise and if a sound is picked up by the mic hanging in front the noise degrate.
If a loud enough noise is recieved the tv shows a distorded camera image of the person sitting in the chair behind the tv listening to music.
This art piece was on display at Nijverheid, Utrecht Februari 2023.
